# AGENTS.md - Project Schema

This is {{ project_name }}: {{ project_description }}

## Agent Role

You own `wiki/`. You write, update, cross-link, and maintain all wiki content.
Humans curate `raw/` and make judgment calls. You handle the bookkeeping.

## How To Orient

When the host exposes the LLM Wiki MCP server, it is your primary surface for
wiki operations — prefer it over shell-family file reads and search:

- Read `wiki/` and `raw/` pages with the `llm_wiki_read` MCP tool (not `cat`,
  `sed`, or a shell read on those paths).
- Find pages with the `llm_wiki_search` MCP tool, and `llm_wiki_search_all` for
  cross-project search, instead of grepping the filesystem.

(On a developer test instance these tools carry a `_test` suffix, e.g.
`llm_wiki_search_test`.) If the MCP server is not configured, fall back to the
index-and-read steps below.

1. Read `project_guidelines.md` for the documentation model and rules.
2. Read `wiki/index.md` for the catalog of all project knowledge.
3. Read specific wiki pages identified from the index (via `llm_wiki_read` when
   the MCP server is available).
4. Read `raw/` sources only when wiki content is insufficient.

Never browse the filesystem to find information. `wiki/index.md` is your
entry point.

## Operations

### Ingest

When new material appears in `raw/`:

1. Read the raw source fully.
2. Identify facts, entities, relationships, decisions.
3. Write or update wiki pages using the correct document type.
4. Check for contradictions with existing wiki content.
5. Update `wiki/index.md`.
6. Append to `wiki/log.md`.

### Query

When answering questions:

1. Search with the `llm_wiki_search` MCP tool first — it ranks across the whole
   project. Read `wiki/index.md` for orientation when the MCP server is
   unavailable.
2. Read the matching pages with `llm_wiki_read` (or directly when no MCP server
   is configured).
3. Synthesize an answer with citations.
4. If the answer is durable new knowledge, file it as a wiki page.

### Lint

Periodically or on request:

1. Scan for contradictions between pages.
2. Find stale statuses or outdated claims.
3. Identify orphan pages not linked from index, deadline files excepted.
4. Check for missing cross-references.
5. Fix issues directly.
6. Log all changes in `wiki/log.md`.

## Conventions

- Document types: spec, decision, proposal, roadmap, plan, checklist,
  reference{% if include_ml_ai %}, experiment, eval{% endif %}.
- Pack-specific document types are listed below when active packs add them.
- Use the type by role, not convenience. See `project_guidelines.md`.
- Every wiki page has a metadata block: Document Class, Status, Date,
  Category, Scope, Sources, and Related when useful.
- Deadline files (`wiki/deadlines/<slug>.deadline.md`) are poman's: they carry
  poman's fields only, `poman check` checks them rather than lint, and the
  index points to their folder, not to each file.
- Filenames: `[slug].type.md` or `[index]-[slug].type.md`.
- Archived documents go to `wiki/archive/`.
- `wiki/log.md` uses format: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] operation | subject`.
